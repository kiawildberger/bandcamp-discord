# bandcamp discord

Integrates Bandcamp website with Discord rich presence using Node.js. Only works on collection page.

## Usage

Clone the repo, install npm packages, and run main.js, preferably with something like [forever](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever) so you don't have to keep the window open.
Install `userscript.js` to a userscript manager like Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey and start honking!

## Known Issues
- crashes and dies when discord is closed
- not very reliable
